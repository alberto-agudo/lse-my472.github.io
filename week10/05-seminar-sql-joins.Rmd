# Practicing SQL joins

In last week's class, we learned simple join. Sometimes, for some of the rows you are joining, you may not be able to find matching records in another table. In that case, you still want to keep the records from one table after JOIN. In this challenge, we will learn how to do that. 

For your reference, the figure below shows different types of joins and how to run the query for each type.

## Get a random sample from the Facebook dataset

Run the code below to create a SQLite database that contains a random sample of the Facebook data we used in week 10.

```{r, eval = F}
library(DBI)
# create database: this will create a file on our hard drive
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "data/facebook-db-mini.sqlite")
# reading the first file
congress <- read.csv("data/congress-facebook-2017.csv",
	stringsAsFactors=F)

# this determines the seed in the pseudo-random number generator
# to guarantee that you always get the same results
# it's good for replicability
set.seed(20191212)
# sample 100 rows randomly
congress <- congress[sample(nrow(congress), 100), ]
# adding first table: user-level data
dbWriteTable(db, "congress", congress)
# testing that it works with a simple query
dbListFields(db, "congress")
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT * FROM congress LIMIT 5')
```


```{r, eval = F}

fls <- list.files("data/posts", full.names=TRUE)
set.seed(20191212)

for (f in fls){
  
  message(f)
  # read file into memory
  fb <- read.csv(f, stringsAsFactors=F)
  # sample 5 percent of rows randomly
  fb <- fb[sample(nrow(fb), size = nrow(fb)/20), ]
  
  # adding to table in SQL database
  dbWriteTable(db, "posts", fb, append=TRUE)
  
}
# testing that it works
dbListFields(db, "posts")
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT * FROM posts LIMIT 5')
# what if we make a mistake and want to remove the table?
# dbRemoveTable(db, "posts")
# and we close the connection for now
dbDisconnect(db)

```

## Questions

```{r}
library(DBI)
library(tidyverse)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "data/facebook-db-mini.sqlite")
```

1. How many rows are there in each table?
```{r}
dbGetQuery(db,
           "SELECT COUNT(*)
            FROM congress")

dbGetQuery(db,
           "SELECT COUNT(*)
            FROM posts")
```

2. How many rows do you get when use `JOIN` to join posts with congress? What kind of join is this? What does this tell us about the data we have?
```{r}
dbGetQuery(db,
           "SELECT COUNT(*)
           FROM posts JOIN congress
           ON posts.screen_name = congress.screen_name")

# Now we have a table of 1787 rows instead of 8530. This is an inner join. It says that from the 8530 posts, we only have information about the status of the politicians in 1787 of them. Or, in other words, the 100 politicians that we have in our sample have posted 1787 different posts as compared with the total of 8530. 
```

3. How many members of congress do not have any posts?
```{r}
dbGetQuery(db,
           "SELECT COUNT(*)
           FROM congress LEFT JOIN posts
           ON congress.screen_name = posts.screen_name
           WHERE posts.screen_name IS NULL")
```

4. How many authors of posts cannot be matched to the members of congress we have in the database?
```{r}
dbGetQuery(db,
           "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT posts.screen_name)
           FROM posts")


dbGetQuery(db,
           "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT posts.screen_name)
           FROM posts LEFT JOIN congress
           ON posts.screen_name = congress.screen_name
           WHERE congress.screen_name IS NULL")

# 403 out of the 500 authors of posts could not be matched. 
```

5. What would you do to create a table that is equivalent to the result of a FULL OUTER JOIN? Hint: look up UNION ALL.
```{r}
#dbGetQuery(db,
#           "SELECT *
#           FROM congress FULL OUTER JOIN posts
#           ON congress.screen_name = posts.screen_name
#           LIMIT 5")

# FULL OUTER JOIN is not currently supported 
dbGetQuery(db,
           "SELECT * 
           FROM congress LEFT JOIN posts
           ON congress.screen_name = posts.screen_name
           WHERE posts.screen_name IS NULL
           UNION ALL
           SELECT * 
           FROM congress JOIN posts
           ON congress.screen_name = posts.screen_name
           UNION ALL
           SELECT * 
           FROM posts LEFT JOIN congress
           ON congress.screen_name = posts.screen_name
           WHERE congress.screen_name IS NULL")

# First, we get the left outer join, then the inner join, and finally the right outer join. We merge them all together and in this way we wouldn't have duplicates. 

```

```{R}
dbDisconnect(db)
```
